CricBuddy is such a platform that you can track the performance of teams in IPL session wise and also analyze the performance of your teams. In CricBuddy, I have tried to convert some simple datasets into the website so that the visualization of IPL is better. And using machine learning under this website, I have created two machine learning models on IPL data sets so that during the IPL match, I can predict the target if the first inning is going on and if the second inning is going on. So the winning percentage of the match can be predicted by feeding some information.

And I have created this platform with the help of Django framework in which the user can register as well as login and logout.
